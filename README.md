# CriticalJustice

## Description 
The project, CriticalJustice, will be focusing on forensic data analysis and data visualization, more specifically, how crime and crime data positively or negatively affects counties in the United States of America. Because of my experience with learning about community and justice studies here at Allegheny College, I would like to make analysis about why crime rate is high or low in certain counties and what factors could be contributing to that rate. The data I collected references the latest Census data which was from 2013.
