## Description 
The project, CriticalJustice, will be focusing on marginalization, specifically in Pittsburgh, PA. Marginalization is the 
treatment of a person, group, or concept as insignificant or peripheral. In the city of Pittsburgh, PA, communities where the 
Black population is higher and the white population is lower, there tends to be a higher percentage of "need", which translates to
the need for neighborhood development, and this information becomes overlooked. 


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to shed light on the primarily Black communities in the city of Pittsburgh. 
With the use of queries, individuals will now be able to see how some factors such as Average Dispatches Per Shot Fired,  
Home Value, and Amount of Shots Fired, contribute to the marginalization of a certain community in Pittsburgh, PA.
