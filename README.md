## Abstract
This tool will visualize several factors in infrastructure and also crime prevention that either positively and negatively affect
neighborhood development. Marginalization is the treatment of a person, group, or concept as insignificant or peripheral, while infrastructure is 
defined as the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads , power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.
In the city of Pittsburgh, PA, communities where the black population is higher and the white population is lower, there tends to be a higher "need" of improvement of specific factors of
infrastructure in that certain community. For instance, these factors can either differ from housing

the need for neighborhood development, and this information becomes overlooked. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to shed light on the primarily Black communities in the city of Pittsburgh. 
With the use of queries, individuals will now be able to see how some factors such as Average Dispatches Per Shot Fired,  
Home Value, and Amount of Shots Fired, contribute to the marginalization of a certain community in Pittsburgh, PA.
